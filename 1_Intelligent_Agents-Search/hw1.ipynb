And Output of this function is a **goal state of search** (if a goal is found), else **FALSE**. <br/>\n",
    "In this version of A*, we aim to find the optimal path and optimal goal. So while there is time, we call the search method of the search engine (**se**) and we look for a path with minimum cost and to save time, We use cost-bounder to prune states which have bigger f_value than the best path cost we found so far. Costbounder is a three tuple that is like (g_val, h_val, g_val + h_val) which each of these 3 are like limit for pruning successor state. Please pay attention that in this version, we prune only when the current final f is larger than best_path_cost<br/>\n",

In each iteration of Simulated Annealing, we calculate the cost of this new state after generating a neighbor state. If it is better than the current state, we accept it and use it as the new current state. But if it is worse than the current state, we calculate an acceptance probability and accept it based on this probability.\n",
